# Context of the practice
We had to make a parser that was available to read and process a FEN String and charge all the information in to a chessboard that we had to make from scratch, a FEN String is basically a text chain that contains information about an especific moment of a game of chess, information like for example the positions of the pieces in that moment, in what play are we, who has to move in that moment and other things like that
